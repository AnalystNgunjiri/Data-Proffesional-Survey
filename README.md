## Conclusion and Recommendation.
**From the analysis, the following conclusion and finding were arrived at**:

        _ That data scients, architects and engineers earns the highest on average.
        - United States has posses the highest income from the proffesion.
        - Python language is more prefered and used by most proffesions in this field.
        - Only a  small fraction of the labour force in the proffesion have a stable worklife balance.
        - Most of the proffesionals in the field about 4% are ok with their salary.
        -That most of the programing language are used in the Tech industry,Telecommunication, Finance and Health sector.
        -The Average age of the proffesionals in the survey displayed implies that most of them might be youths below age of 30 year.
        - The Proffesion is dominated by Males at approximately 74% with each having a take home salary of about $32k on average.

_**Recomendation**_: For a deep dive into the analysis, the dataset has to be expanded and updated for better descision.
